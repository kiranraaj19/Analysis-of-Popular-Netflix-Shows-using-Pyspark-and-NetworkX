# Analysis-of-Popular-Netflix-Shows-using-Pyspark-and-NetworkX

Behind the recommendation system is a hidden bipartite graph, but we never questioned how other movies get view counts and are affected because of the popular show, and we can analyze this using a social network. The research paper will be a thorough analysis of the patterns and results of what the top shows in Netflix do to get to the place, how other movies were involved in making the show famous and how other similar movies performed. What were the limitations of a similar movie that didnâ€™t get it into the top. How similar movies benefited because of a similar viral TV show. We will use PySpark to parse through a large dataset in a distributed environment and get the required outputs and visualize them using NetworkX which is a python library for visualizing networks. The research paper's main outcome will be discussing the effect of an instant viral show on different related shows, how the viewers flow from one egocentric node, i.e., the viral TV show to other nodes of similar genre or same studios or having same actors/cast.
